# vite-react-js-template
Vite JS for rapid development of React Apps

## What is Vite ?
- It's a next generation Frontend Tooling, a library of Javascript which helps us to build React, Angular or Vue Apps very much faster than it's own package.
- If we use ```npx create-react-app``` command it would take at least 5 minutes( depend on PC/Laptop resources ) to make a basic boiler template but with ```Vit JS``` it can do the job within seconds.
- While developing the React app ```Hot Reloading``` issue will be solved in Vite JS whenever we change some code in our app.

## Installation 
- Create an React + Vite App
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
- Go to Project Folder Directory( In this case our Project name is "cd react-vite-startup-template" )
```bash
cd react-vite-startup-template
```
- Install Node & Other Essential Modules
```bash
npm install
```
- Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Acces the App (Localhost)
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```
